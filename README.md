# cyber_Plan
My Cybersecurity Journey to SOC Analyst
- Actual documentation of my learning experience
- Projects implemented with code
- Goals achieved and lessons learned
My plan to get a job as a SOC Analyst in 6 months (I think it might take longer, but it is possible)
Let me know if you notice anything I can improve!!
(Iâ€™m not starting from scratch, but this repository contains a detailed roadmap for becoming a SOC Analyst, focusing on the most demanded skills, certifications, and practical projects that I realized by researching job openings and studying on top of it, I would add CCNA course)
